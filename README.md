# RhythmofBamboos
The Rhythm of Bamboos has won the support through the Open Call for proposals: Cultural and Artistic Responses to Environmental Change! The open call was supported by @princeclausfund and @goetheinstitut. Our project focuses on the balance between environment and industrialisation, culture and economical growth in JianÂ´Ou, one of the most typical rural villages in China. Benefited from our interdisciplinary backgrounds, we will touch upon sculpture, architecture, film making, and handicraft workshops in the project. Through the application of diverse art forms, we tend to build a sustainable, gender-friendly, and inclusive environment in Yang Hou village.
